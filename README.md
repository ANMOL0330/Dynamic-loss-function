The main purpose of this project is to analyse the drawbacks in currently used loss functions, analysing the classification error in Cross-Entropy loss function and implementing the research paper "Leader Learning Loss Function", proposing a novel method of solving classification error.
"Variation-of-leader-learning-loss-function" contains the notebook.
"NYCTaxifare" contains dataset.
